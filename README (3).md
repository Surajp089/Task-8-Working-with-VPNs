# Internship Task 8 – Working with VPNs (ProtonVPN)

## Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and enabling secure communication.

---

## Tools Used
- **VPN Client** – ProtonVPN (Free tier) / Windscribe Free
- **IP Checker** – [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
- **Operating System** – Windows 10 (64-bit)
- **Web Browser** – Google Chrome
- **Internet Speed Test** – [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net)

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. VPN Setup & Testing
- Created a free account on ProtonVPN.

### 2. Installing ProtonVPN
- Downloaded and installed ProtonVPN on the computer.
- Signed in using the registered credentials.

### 3. Connecting to VPN Server
- Connected to the **Netherlands server**.

### 4. Verifying IP Change
- Opened [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before and after connecting.
- Verified that the IP address and location changed to match the VPN server region.

### 5. Testing Encrypted Browsing
- Accessed **YouTube** to confirm traffic was routed through the Netherlands VPN server.

### 6. Disconnecting and Comparing
- Disconnected VPN and compared:
  - IP address
  - Browsing speed
  - Location

### 7. Internet Speed Comparison
- **Without VPN:** Faster browsing speed.
- **With VPN:** Slightly lower speed due to encryption overhead.

## Research on VPN Encryption & Privacy (ProtonVPN)

### Overview
ProtonVPN is developed by the team behind ProtonMail in Switzerland, a country known for strong privacy laws. It focuses on encryption strength and user privacy.

### Encryption Standard
- **AES-256-bit encryption**
  - Military-grade encryption
  - Resistant to brute-force attacks
  - 256-bit key length = \(2^{256}\) possible combinations

### Tunneling Protocols
- **OpenVPN (TCP & UDP)** – Secure, open-source, balances speed and security
- **IKEv2/IPSec** – Good for mobile devices with fast reconnection
- **WireGuard** – Lightweight, faster, modern cryptography

### Key Privacy Features
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**
  - Session keys change regularly, preventing past data decryption
- **Secure Core Servers**
  - Routes traffic through privacy-friendly countries before the internet
- **No-Logs Policy**
  - No browsing, IP, or session data stored
- **DNS Leak Protection**
  - Prevents DNS queries from bypassing the VPN
- **Kill Switch & Always-On**
  - Blocks internet if VPN disconnects unexpectedly

## Summary on VPN Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Privacy** – Hides real IP and location
2. **Data Encryption** – Protects against eavesdropping
3. **Bypass Geo-Restrictions** – Access blocked content
4. **Protection on Public Networks** – Prevents MITM attacks
5. **Avoid ISP Throttling** – Stops ISPs from slowing specific traffic

### Limitations
1. **Reduced Speed** – Due to encryption and server routing
2. **Not Complete Anonymity** – Providers may log some data
3. **Service Blocking** – Some sites block VPN IPs
4. **Legal Restrictions** – VPN use restricted in some countries
5. **Free Plan Limits** – Fewer locations, slower speed, data caps

---

## Limitations in ProtonVPN Free Version
- Access to only **3 countries**: Netherlands, Japan, USA
- Lower speed due to server congestion
- No P2P or Secure Core servers

---

## Real-World Usage Notes
- Encryption may slightly reduce browsing speed
- VPN hides IP but cannot prevent all tracking (cookies, fingerprinting)
- Works well for bypassing censorship in certain regions
